# Recipe Box
A webapp using Food2Fork API to display food recipes. By searching food name or ingredients, good recipe can be found quickly based on social-media ranking. For each request send, it will return a maximum of 30 results.
## Motivation
This project is created for the purpose of practicing Javascript and Node.js.

Recipe websites nowadays seem to have very 'messy' design by cramming too much information on the page. I want to create simple and clean interface by search recipes through searching bar.
## Description of features

Searching recipe by typing name or ingredients. It will show suggested recipes through pictures. By clicking to title, all instructions for the recipe will be displayed.

I was planning to create the wish list for users so that users can store their favorite recipes in their own account. Due to the access limitation to the API database, I could not make the wish list work.
